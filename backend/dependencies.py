"""
This file is the actual security boundary of the whole app.

get_current_user()  -> decodes the JWT sent by the client and loads the
                        matching User row. Rejects with 401 if the token
                        is missing/invalid/expired.

require_role(*roles) -> a dependency FACTORY. Call it with the roles that
                        are allowed to hit a given route, e.g.
                        require_role("librarian") or
                        require_role("student", "librarian").
                        It rejects with 403 if the logged-in user's role
                        isn't in the allowed list.

Every protected route in routers/ depends on one of these. This is what
stops a student from being able to call an admin endpoint directly
(e.g. via curl/Postman) even if they never see the admin page in the UI -
the frontend redirect alone would NOT be enough.
